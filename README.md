## What we learned
It was a great learning experience for both of us, it was the first time one of us was introduced to Nest.js and typeScript. We built our frontend with typeScript only, so got a lot of errors but I quickly got the hang of it. We also learnt to use Gihub efficiently and its our first time making a detailed Readme file for our users.


## What's next for MauKerja 
We are planning to add a lot of features to the application to make it useful for students as well as mentors :-
- **Improving the UI** :- As the application is built within a span of 2 days, we would focus in improving its UI and making it more user-friendly
- **Adding more free resources** :- We are adding a lot more resources like Development Roadmaps, Interview Preparation Resources, Data Structures and Algorithms CheatSheets, Open Source Contributions etc. One of our aim is to provide free high quality education to fellows, so that they can get learning resources as well as career opportunities on the same platform.
- **Improving Events Facilities** :- Events are essential for students as it improves their technical, behavioural and communication skills. Through MauKerja, one can attend any event and can also host an event. The event may be a hackathon, workshop or a seminar. We would like to add video conference like features and chat boxes through whichfolks attending an event can interact on the application only
- **Chat Box for Mentors** :- We will add a chat box for each mentor so that any mentee who's interested in being guded can interact directly to them.
- **Integrating Payment Methods** :- As we are allowing Mentors to give private/group lessons to the students, we'll make sure that they can make some side earnings too. We will add payments methods in the guidance section and would keep in check if they are charging highðŸ˜„
